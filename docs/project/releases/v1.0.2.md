# Release v1.0.2 (2025-12-01)

## Highlights
- Progress logging helpers (`create_progress_tracker`, `log_progress`) are now exported from
  `spark_fuse.utils.progress`, making it easy to add elapsed-time bars to notebooks.
- The data-processing template uses `DataFrame.write.change_tracking` (with schema evolution) by
  default and shows Delta history before and after writes for quick debugging.

## Upgrade Notes
- No code changes required for existing pipelines. Notebook users can import the new progress
  helpers and adopt the refreshed template path (`/tmp/spark_fuse/orders_enriched_ct`) if desired.

## Detailed Changes
### Added
- Shared progress helpers for consistent step/timing logging across notebooks.
- Pre- and post-write Delta log inspection cells in the template notebook.

### Changed
- Template write target renamed to `/tmp/spark_fuse/orders_enriched_ct` and now prefers
  `write.change_tracking` with schema evolution enabled on Delta targets, falling back to Parquet
  when Delta is unavailable.
