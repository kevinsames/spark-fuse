# Release v1.0.1 (2025-11-18)

## Highlights
- `scd2_upsert` now replays duplicate keys within a single batch in chronological order so every
  change is stored as its own historical row.
- The SCD demo notebook includes a "multiple updates per batch" walk-through to visualize the new
  sequencing behavior directly in Delta Lake output.

## Upgrade Notes
- No action is required for existing pipelines. The helper automatically sequences inputs that have
  not been pre-deduplicated and will continue to behave as before when one row per key is provided.

## Detailed Changes
### Added
- Regression tests that feed multiple rows for a single key through `scd2_upsert` to validate that
  every version is created.

### Changed
- `scd2_upsert` partitions each batch by business key and load order so earlier versions are closed
  before inserting later ones, retaining complete history at write time.

### Documentation
- Noted the new intra-batch sequencing behavior in the SCD guide and notebook, including a dedicated
  example that shows the resulting timeline of versions.
