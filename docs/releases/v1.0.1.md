# Release v1.0.1 (2025-11-18)

## Highlights
- `scd2_upsert` now replays duplicate keys within a single batch in chronological order so every
  change is stored as its own historical row.
- The SCD demo notebook includes a "multiple updates per batch" walk-through and schema-evolution
  examples for both SCD1 and SCD2 to visualize the resulting Delta output.
- Optional schema evolution (`allow_schema_evolution=True`) lets Delta automatically add columns when
  the upstream dataset introduces new attributes across both SCD helpers.

## Upgrade Notes
- No action is required for existing pipelines. The helper automatically sequences inputs that have
  not been pre-deduplicated and will continue to behave as before when one row per key is provided.

## Detailed Changes
### Added
- Regression tests that feed multiple rows for a single key through `scd2_upsert` to validate that
  every version is created.
- `allow_schema_evolution` flag on `scd1_upsert` and `scd2_upsert` to turn on Delta schema evolution
  during merges/appends.

### Changed
- `scd2_upsert` partitions each batch by business key and load order so earlier versions are closed
  before inserting later ones, retaining complete history at write time.

### Documentation
- Noted the new intra-batch sequencing behavior in the SCD guide and notebook, including a dedicated
  example that shows the resulting timeline of versions.
